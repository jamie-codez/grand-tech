Their legacy reporting system generated static monthly reports that were difficult to understand and didn't allow clients to explore their data. Advisors spent excessive time preparing for client meetings and answering basic questions about portfolio performance. The firm needed a solution that would empower clients with self-service analytics while providing advisors with deeper insights to guide investment decisions.",
        approach:
            "We began with extensive user research, interviewing both clients and financial advisors to understand their needs and pain points. Based on these insights, we designed a dashboard architecture focused on data visualization, real-time updates, and personalized views. We prioritized security and compliance throughout the development process, ensuring the solution met financial industry regulations.",

The solution features real-time portfolio tracking, interactive performance charts, asset allocation visualization, goal tracking, document management, and customizable reports. For advisors, we implemented additional tools for client management, portfolio analysis, and scenario modeling. The dashboard integrates with multiple financial data providers and the firm's existing CRM and portfolio management systems.",

Client satisfaction scores have increased by 45%, and the firm has attracted $150 million in new assets under management, partly attributed to their enhanced digital capabilities. The dashboard has become a key differentiator in their sales process and client retention strategy.",

The system includes online ordering, table management, kitchen display, inventory tracking, and reporting features. This solution has streamlined operations, improved customer experience, and provided valuable business insights for the restaurant group.",

They were using a combination of paper tickets, legacy POS systems, and third-party delivery platforms that didn't integrate well. This led to order errors, delays in service, inventory discrepancies, and limited visibility into business performance. They needed a unified system that would streamline operations while enhancing the customer experience both in-restaurant and for takeout/delivery orders.",

Based on these insights, we designed a comprehensive system architecture that addressed the full order lifecycle while maintaining flexibility for different restaurant concepts within the group.",
